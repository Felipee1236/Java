Exercises from Mooc.fi Java Programming I
Started on 21/02/2024
Progress so far (24/02): I’ve learned a lot of things—and actually remembered a lot too. I’ve covered loops, if/else statements, and similar basics. Nothing too advanced yet. I paused at methods, which I plan to learn outside the Mooc.fi course. I didn’t fully grasp the explanations on their site, but I’ll keep working through their exercises.
