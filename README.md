### **Milestones**
- **24/02/2024:**
  - Completed basic concepts (loops, conditionals, etc.).
  - Paused at methods to study them in more depth outside the course.
- **28/02/2025:**
  - Finished **Part 2** of Mooc.fi Java Programming I.
  - Gained a solid understanding of methods and their applications.
  - Feeling confident about my progress and excited to continue learning!
